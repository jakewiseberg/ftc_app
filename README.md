# Master Branch
Stable, somewhat up to date, tested.

## Rule of Thumb
This branch has been tested dozens of times and is nearly guaranteed to work. If existing code somehow does not work, first check the common errors (is it on, is it wired, is there a hardware issue, is it configured, is it clearly broken in one situation).

## TODO
1. Decrease camera resolution
2. Gyroscopic movement
3. Line tracking (? unnecessary)
