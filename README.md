#Ortess Import

##Disclaimer
This is prob the most unstable branch you will use in your entire life, and there is a 99% guarantee that it will not gradle build. Absolutely do not use unless you're some kind of pro with gradle and dependencies.

##Dependencies
Package org.fawkes.fawkesrc is dependent for utilities on com.qualcomm.robotcore
This prob does not have a bunch of code so jsut comment out blocks that don't work. I'll add the obfuscated libraries later.

##History
This is from the ortess branch we hosted using Subversion instead of git, meaning it might have artifacts from that.
Also the cam might take up too much of the screen etc etc
