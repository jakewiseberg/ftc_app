#Nightly builds

##Disclaimer
it says nightly but its basically a beta branch
super unstable etc etc dont use

##USAGE
when using any of the unstable branches that have container apps:
- don't open the master
- open FawkesRC folder as a project within Android Studio
- if you need to edit the qualcomm files use VS Code, don't break anything
- if you delete resources or comment out stuff put it in the push, and when using this and ortess imports there is a high likelihood that stuff will be missing
- hardwaremap is attached to main activity

##Organization
package is org fawkes fawkes rc, dependent on qualcomm robotcore, you wont see the package in android studio
ill add more info here in coming time

``` python
print "please.py is an amazing utility 10/10 recommend you execute it!"
