##IMPORTANT PLEASE READ
I feel so unsure As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies, something in your eyes Calls to mind the silver screen And all its sad good-byes I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know your not a fool Should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste the chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you! *jazz*
